            <h2>Universal Magna Sirgas</h2>
            <p>
              As a proficient programmer, I utilized Python and spatial technologies to develop an intuitive and efficient API for coordinate transformations within my country. This project is expected to be publicly available later this year. The purpose of this development project is creating a valuable tool for Colombian Space Engineers at the time a community grows around the ESPÆCIAL organization, giving more value to our country and the world with tools that team has planned for different terms. <a class="url" href="https://github.com/ESPAECIAL/UniversalMagnaSirgas">Source Code</a>

            <h2>GLOSS-SHOES</h2>
            <p>
              As the project leader, I spearheaded the development of an engaging e-commerce platform for a local shoe factory, utilizing Python, Django, and SQL. I also guided the team in product image segmentation and logistics tasks. <a class="url" href="https://github.com/ESPAECIAL/UniversalMagnaSirgas">Source Code</a>

            <h3>IGAC</h3>
            <p>
              I spearheaded the development of a robust spatial database and web solution using Java, Python, and Django for efficient scientific computations in geodesy. My programming skills encompassed algorithms, SQL, and web development. <a class="url" href="https://github.com/depicted-candela/JToolsQgeoid">JToolsQgeoid</a> <a class="url" href="https://github.com/depicted-candela/qgeoidcol">qgeoidcol</a>

            <h3>Telespazio Argentina S.A.</h3>
            <p>
              As a GIS Professional at Telespazio Argentina S.A., I led a team of space engineers, fostering collaboration and ensuring timely project delivery. I also played a key role in systematization tasks using Python and SQL. My responsibilities included data processing, updating spatial information for the Multipurpose Cadastral project. My ability to manage spatial data with XML for LADMCol standardization and my programming skills in Python were valuable assets in this role. Specially I created an spatial algorithm for standardize nomenclatures.

            <h3>Land People</h3>
            <p>
              During my time as a Spatial Data Analyst at Land People, I utilized my expertise in Python and GIS to standardize spatial data according to the LADM Col model for Colombia's Multipurpose Cadastral project. My focus was on efficiently loading massive datasets into physical databases.
            </p>
            <h3>CEICOL SAS</h3>
            <p>
              While working as a GIS Junior Developer at CEICOL SAS, I provided coding assistance for the Multipurpose Cadastral System of Colombia. I wrote SQL queries (both spatial and ordinary) to process data and ensure its accuracy.  My skills in Python and algorithms were instrumental in this project.

            <p>
              I assumed a leadership role, utilizing my expertise in GIS and spatial data analysis to capture, process, and share information about social conflicts during protests in Bogota. This project aimed to raise awareness about police violence through spatial data visualization. <a class="url" href="https://www.instagram.com/21cesco/?hl=es">@21ceso</a> in instagram.

            <h3>Final Year Project</h3>
            <h4>Diseño de una Metodología para la Estimación Espacial de la Eutrofización en el Lago de Tota</h4>
            <p>
              In this project, I spearheaded the development of a predictive model for waterbody pollution using Python and R. This research showcased the potential of remote sensing, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics for cost-effective water quality monitoring.
